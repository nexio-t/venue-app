# Venuely 

> A simple app to find all the information for your next stop

Trying to plan a weekend? Have a spot in mind? Enter Venuely, an app that searches for venues and finds it's location, contact information, reviews, hours, and website, if applicable. This app was primarily built with React, Bulma, and Google APIs, among other technologies. 


### Demo

If you'd like to try Venuely yourself, visit the live verison here(). Choose a specific place, whether restaurant, museum, landmark, park, or store, and enter it into the search bar. Here are a few good ones to start off: 


```
Philadelphia Museum of Art
```

```
National Constitution Center
```

```
Urban Outfitters Center City 
```
